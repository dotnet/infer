    If you try to override output path directly from the command line (or release.yml) then
    you lose the target-framework subdirectories (for example, instead of building into $(OutputPath)\netstandard2.0
    you just build into $(OutputPath)) - this usually isn't what you want. The workaround here
    is to set an intermediate variable BaseOutputPath from the command line (or release.yml) and
    then set that to OutputPath here, which preserves the target-framework subdirectories.
