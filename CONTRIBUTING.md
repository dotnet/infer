# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Infer&#46;NET!

Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://github.com/dotnet/home/blob/main/guidance/net-foundation-contribution-license-agreement.pdf.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).
