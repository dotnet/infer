# Building Infer.NET from its source code

- [Building with Visual Studio 2019](#building-with-visual-studio-2019)
- [Building from the command line](#building-from-the-command-line)

To build from source, you must first clone the repository.
Next decide whether you want to use a code editor like Visual Studio (recommended) or the command line.
When building, you must select a configuration.
All of the Infer&#46;NET libraries target .NET Standard 2.0. Projects that produce executables (including test projects) mostly target .NET Framework 4.6.1, .NET Core 3.1, or both depending on build configuration:

| Configurations | Targeted Frameworks |
|:---|---:|
| Debug, Release | both .NET Framework 4.6.1 and .NET Core 3.1 |
| DebugFull, ReleaseFull | .NET Framework 4.6.1 only |
| DebugCore, ReleaseCore | .NET Core 3.1 only |


## Building with Visual Studio 2019

1. If you don't have Visual Studio 2019, you can install the free [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
1. Start Visual Studio.
1. Select `File -> Open -> Project/Solution` and open the `Infer.sln` solution file located in your cloned repository.
1. Select a build configuration using `Build -> Configuration Manager...`.  After switching between configurations that change the targeted frameworks, Visual Studio currently requires you to close and re-open the solution file using `File -> Close Solution` and `File -> Open`.
1. Compile using `Build -> Build Solution`.
1. At this point, you can play with the [tutorials and examples](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/userguide/Infer.NET%20tutorials%20and%20examples.html), or run all tests to verify the installation.  Run the tutorials by setting the startup project to `Tutorials`.  If your configuration is `DebugFull` or `ReleaseFull`, you will get the [Examples Browser](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/userguide/The%20examples%20browser.html).  Otherwise, edit `src/Tutorials/RunMe.cs` to see different tutorials.  Run an example by setting the startup project to that example.
1. To run all tests, open the test explorer using `Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer`.
1. In the test explorer search bar, type `-Trait:"BadTest" -Trait:"OpenBug" -Trait:"CompilerOptionsTest" -Trait:"Performance" -Trait:"Platform"` to exclude long-running tests and tests that are not supposed to succeed.
1. Click `Run All`.

## Building with Visual Studio Code

1. Launch [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
1. Select the Extensions button on the left, then install C# and the NuGet Package Manager extensions. 
1. Select File -> Open Folder.. and select the folder containing Infer.sln. 
1. Press F5 or select Run -> Start Debugging.  When prompted, select .NET Core and then select the example that you want to run.
1. For more details, see the [README for the C# extension](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/master/debugger.md).

## Building from the command line

The core components of Infer&#46;NET run on .NET Core 3.1.  Some optional code, such as the [Examples Browser](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/userguide/The%20examples%20browser.html), use [Windows Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/) and therefore require .NET framework or Mono. 
Some samples, such as the [Monty Hall problem](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/userguide/Monty%20Hall%20problem.html), use [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/introduction-to-wpf) and therefore require Windows.

### Prerequisites

* **[.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/)** to build and run .NET Standard and .NET Core projects.

* (Optional) On Windows, the **[.NET framework developer pack](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)**.  On other platforms, **[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)** (version 5.0 and higher) and the **[NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools)** package manager.

### Build 

To build .NET Standard libraries and .NET Core executables, run in the root of the repository either
```bash
dotnet build -c DebugCore Infer.sln
```
to build debug assemblies, or
```bash
dotnet build -c ReleaseCore Infer.sln
```
to build release assemblies.

When not using Windows, expect build failure messages about examples that use WPF GUI. Libraries and executables that don't reference WPF should build, though.

### Run unit tests

Unit tests are written using the [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) framework.
The easiest way to run all tests is to execute the script `netcoretest.sh` or `monotest.sh`.
To run unit tests manually from the command line:
```bash
dotnet test Infer.sln -c <configuration> <filter>
```
See the scripts for example filters.

There are three test assemblies in the solution:

- **Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic.Tests.dll** in the folder `test/Tests`. 
- **TestPublic.dll** in the folder `test/TestPublic`.
- **Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic.Learners.Tests.dll** in the folder `test/Learners/LearnersTests`. 

Depending on the build configuration and targeted framework, the assemblies will be located in the `bin/Debug<Core|Full>/<net5.0|net461>` or `bin/Release<Core|Full>/<net5.0|net461>` subdirectories
of the test project.

Runner executes tests in parallel by default. However, some test category must be run
sequentially. Such categories are:
- _Performance_
- _DistributedTest_
- _CsoftModel_
- _ModifiesGlobals_

_CompilerOptionsTest_ is a category for long running tests, so, for quick
testing you must filter these out by `Category!=CompilerOptionsTest`.
_BadTest_ is a category of tests that must fail.
_OpenBug_ is a category of tests that can fail.


## Fast matrix operations with Intel MKL
Matrix operations in Infer.NET can be significantly accelerated by building with Intel MKL support.
This requires building Infer.NET with a special option.
In Runtime project settings > Build:
1. Add ";LAPACK" to the Conditional compilation symbols.
1. Check `Allow unsafe code`.

You can also use other BLAS/LAPACK libraries compatible with MKL.  If your library is not called "mkl_rt.dll", change the `dllName` string in [Lapack.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/infer/blob/main/src/Runtime/Core/Maths/Lapack.cs).

When using this special build of Infer.NET, you must tell your code where to find the MKL dynamic libraries.
1. Download [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl/) which includes redistributables. Typically, this is installed in  `C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\compilers_and_libraries\windows\redist\intel64_win`. We'll reference this folder as *MKL_DIR*.
1. (Optional) Add *MKL_DIR* to the environment variable PATH.  If you do this, the remaining steps are unnecessary, but your code will only run on machines where this has been done.
1. Add the MKL dynamic libraries as items to your project that uses Infer.NET.
   1. `Project > Add Existing Item`
   2. Navigate to your MKL binaries folder *MKL_DIR*.
   3. Change the file type dropdown to "All Files".
   4. Select the libraries listed in the [MKL linkage guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-math-kernel-library-intel-mkl-linkage-and-distribution-quick-reference-guide): `mkl_rt.dll`, `mkl_intel_thread.dll`, `mkl_core.dll`, `libiomp5md.dll`, etc.
   5. Click "Add" or "Add as Link"
1. For each of the added items, change the "Copy to output directory" property to "Copy if newer".  When you build your project, the MKL libraries will be included alongside the Infer.NET libraries.

## Embedding Infer.NET source code in your own project

If you plan to reference the Infer.NET source code from your own project, we recommend using a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).  A Git submodule refers to a specific commit of Infer.NET and ensures that anyone who clones your project will get the version of Infer.NET that your code works with.  To set up this submodule, you only need to type:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/dotnet/infer
```
